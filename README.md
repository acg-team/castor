Authors: Lorenzo Gatti & Massimo Maiolo

----

### Releases

#### Version 1.0.7 / 02.07.2018
    
> #### Task

- [[MIN-43](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-43)] -         Add ML/wML to Initial tree topology estimator schemes (pairwise distances)
- [[MIN-44](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-44)] -         Pairwise distance estimation should be computed under nested models (+PIP)
    
> #### Bug

- [[MIN-40](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-40)] -         Initial likelihood value does not match with MSA score
- [[MIN-41](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-41)] -         Initial tree topology cannot be performed under PIP model. Distance measure is missing
- [[MIN-42](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-42)] -         Optimisation of branches during initial tree estimation cannot be performed under PIP
            
> #### Story

- [[MIN-8](https://devops.lorenzogatti.me/browse/MIN-8)] -         Design new parameter optimization routine to support more complex scenarios (using lk tolerance)
